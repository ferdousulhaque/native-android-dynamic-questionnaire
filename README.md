## Native Android Dynamic Questionnaire System
<ul>
    <li>While I was working on a market research project, I had to develop an android app for collecting questionnaire from 
    different persons in a mobile/tab. This includes:
    </li>
    
    <li>1. Single Option - Take one option from multiple options</li>
    <li>2. Multiple Options - Take multiple option from multiple options</li>
    <li>3. Verbatim - Voice for the question asked</li>
    
    <li>Questions can be taken from any language, for DB I have used sqlite. A sqlite file needs to be stored in the storage
    of the device.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>After cloning this repository, go to the src folder, run the following command/s,
    <pre>
    
    </pre>
</li>


</ul>
